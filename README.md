# An investigation into the potential sentiment disparity in earnings calls between prepared presentations and real-time Q&As.

## Introduction

Every quarter investors eagerly await company's earnings calls to hear management's perspective on a company's business performance. These earnings calls typically consist of two sections: a presentation which is a prepared speech by management, and a Q&A section during which management need to answer select shareholder questions. Acknowledging the importance of these transcripts company's spend a lot of time ensuring that the presentation is precisely worded to convey the company's health in the correct tone, however, during the Q&A section questions need to be answered in real time and are perhaps more revealing to the true state of the company. So, perhaps there is an information advantage to be exploited by performing sentiment analysis on each segment separately potentially exposing 'truer' beliefs. To begin with I want to look at the sentiment disparity between the two sections, but perhaps (time permitting) will expand the project to see if which section is more illuminating, or if the transcript should be digested as a whole for the most accurate interpretation.

## Data Sources and Descriptions

All data is downloaded from a [kaggle data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashwinm500/earnings-call-transcripts/code). The data contains Quarterly Earnings Call Transcripts for 10 NASDAQ companies from 2016-2020 in the form plain text files (.txt).

TODO: Will likely use BERT or another pre-trained model alongside my own sentiment analysis model to compare the two. 

## Method

TODO: Explain the method used to analyse the data.

## Results

TODO: Explain the results of the analysis.

## Conclusion

TODO: Summarise the findings and suggest future expansion.
